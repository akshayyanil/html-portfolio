<h1>About Me </h1>
<p>I'm a passionate and curious BCA student with a strong interest in web development, especially the MERN stack. Currently diving deep into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I enjoy building clean and interactive websites that combine both functionality and design. My journey started from scratch, and every line of code I write pushes me to explore and learn more.
</p>

<p>Beyond tech, I'm a creative thinker who believes that problem-solving is at the heart of every great project. I also have an interest in design, multimedia, and storytelling — skills that help me approach development from a unique perspective. Whether it’s a class project, a coding challenge, or just experimenting with new frameworks, I love bringing ideas to life through code.
</p>

<p>’m constantly working to improve my skills and build real-world projects that showcase my growth. My goal is to become internship-ready, gain hands-on experience, and eventually contribute to impactful tech solutions.
